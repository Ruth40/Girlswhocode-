             the title of his book. This podcast focuses on the little things that often go overlooked in our
             daily lives. Hidden Brain unravels patterns that influence our behaviors, the instincts that guide
             our choices, and elements that affect the unfolding of our relationships.

             She worried about disappointing them. She also worried that her mental health issues were
              frivolous compared with the struggles that her parents, who grew up in Pakistan and emigrated
               to the United States, have endured.

      <h2><span class="w3-tag w3-wide" style="font-size:20px">Tips from Ruth:</span></h2>

      <h4><p>Personally, I make sure I give myself time to reflect on my thoughts
        and also short breaks whenever I feel too stressed out. I also make sure to journal
        whenever I can because I think it's important to let out your emotions one way or the other.</p></h4>


        <h2><span class="w3-tag w3-wide" style="font-size:20px">Tips from Taitu:</span></h2>

        <h4><p>My tips for having better mental health are:
          removing yourself from the situations that stress you out the most,
          spending some time alone and reflecting on your emotions, reaching out and
          surrounding yourself with friends who understand and care for you, and listening to the music you enjoy most.
          Personally, when I am not feeling great I listen to music that matches my current emotional state, this
          usually helps me express my feelings without having to say it in my own words. Surrounding yourself with people
          who understand what you are experiencing is also great because it helps you to feel less isolated.</p></h4>


          <h2><span class="w3-tag w3-wide" style="font-size:20px">Tips from Jennifer:</span></h2>

          <h4><p>I personally have some anxiety from school and from trying to plan out my
            future at a young age. What I do to cope with anxiety and stress is
            <i><b>talking about how I feel to a friend.</b></i> What I do is explain what is causing my stess and how I feel about having stress.
            Then I would try to figure out a way how to make the situation better. For example I would spit out all my assignments that I have piled up to my friend.
            Then talk about how overwhelming it is to have so many things to do in a short amount of time. Finally when I feel calm again I then make
            a list to figure out how long each assiment could take and also plan to have enough time to relax. Just talking about what is on my mind lifts a
            lot of weight off my shoulders. It doesn't have to be a friend, you could also talk to stuff animals.</p></h4>


          <h2><span class="w3-tag w3-wide" style="font-size:20px">Tips from Samantha:</span></h2>

          <h4 class="w3-padding-me"><p>Personally, I get social anxiety in places full of people I do not know; for example me
            moving to a new soccer team or school. On top of that I am horrible at being social in general, in terms of talking,
            so of course the feeling of being somewhere new is nerve wracking. I’m constantly thinking of some extreme situations, as if
            everyone is watching me or even cares what I'm doing. So I tend to hide in a shell, keeping to myself.
            To be honest, there is not much I can do to avoid these situations as it is going to happen later on in my life as well.
            To deal with it, I just take a deep breath and plug my headphones in and say, “I earned my place to be here”, and keep walking forward.
            As I’m walking, I dance a little or maybe even lip sync to the song playing through my headphones; something upbeat to relax myself.
            My experience with social anxiety is not as intense as others but it this is just how I deal with it myself. At the end of the day, no
            one is going to remember that you stuttered over your words in that speech that one time or how you tripped over your shoe laces five years from now,
            and if they do, I doubt they would care.</p></h4>
