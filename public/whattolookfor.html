      People with anxiety disorders respond to certain objects or situations with fear and dread.
      Anxiety can be tough for anyone to deal with, but add in the whirlwind of changes that come with adolescence,
      and anxiety can feel like an intrusive mind hog. First though, it’s important to understand the
      telltale signs of anxiety and where they come from. When you understand this, anxiety will start to lose the power
      that comes from its mystery and its unpredictability. An anxiety disorder is diagnosed if a person:
    </p>

    <p>
      <li class="w3-margin-left w3-margin-right">
        Has an inappropriate response to a situation
      </li>

      <li class="w3-margin-left w3-margin-right">
        Cannot control the response
      </li>

      <li class="w3-margin-left w3-margin-right">
        Has an altered way of life due to the anxiety

      Social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects 1 out of 3 adolescents
      between 13 and 18 years old. It is the most common anxiety disorder and third most
      common mental health disorder in the country. Social Anxiety Disorder, also known as Social Phobia,
      is marked by ongoing and pervasive fear of social interaction and/or situations where embarrassment might occur.
      While it is common to experience some anxiety in new social situations, individuals with social anxiety disorder feel:
    </p>

    <p>
      <li class="w3-margin-left w3-margin-right">
        Overwhelming self-consciousness
      </li>

      Teenagers with anorexia may take extreme measures to avoid eating and control
      the quantity and quality of the foods they do eat. They may become abnormally thin,
      or thin for their body, and still talk about feeling fat.

      If you have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), you have repeated, upsetting thoughts called obsessions. You do the same thing over and over again to try to make the thoughts go away. Those repeated actions are called compulsions.
      Examples of obsessions are a fear of germs or a fear of being hurt. Compulsions include washing your hands, counting, checking on things or cleaning. Untreated, OCD can take over your life.
